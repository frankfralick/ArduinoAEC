ArduinoAEC
==========

A small collection that illustrates how to get access to Arduino data in common AEC modelling platforms using Python.

The intent of this repo to start off with will be to provide extremely basic examples that show how you can easily take Arduino sensory information and modify models through various platform API's.  

Dependencies:

Arduino IDE - sort of obvious, if you want to program your Arduino, you need this. 

PySerial - This Python package is used for handling serial communication between your Python programs and the Arduino		

Python 2.7 - For interfacing with platforms like Rhino and Revit, you don't necessarily need this since these rely on IronPython.  If you want to use a windows installer, however, you will need the regular distribution of Python.

PythonWin - Python for Windows utilities from Mark Hammond.
